In collaboration with Casey Holliday ([University of
Missouri](http://hollidaylab.com/)), Larry Witmer ([Ohio
University](http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/dbms-witmer/lab.htm)), and
Julian Davis ([University of Southern
Indiana](http://faculty.usi.edu/jldavis2)), we are beginning an
NSF-funded project to study the evolution of cranial kinesis across
the non-avian theropod dinosaur to bird transition.

Cranial kinesis (movement among the bones of the skull, excepting the
jaw) required a significant reorganization of skeletal tissues and
was likely a major evolutionary factor in the highly diverse feeding
apparatus and ultimately the diversification of modern birds. The
goal of this project is to understand the biomechanical environment of
the feeding system.
