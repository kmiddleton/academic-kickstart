We have a long-term collaborative project with [Dr. Theodore Garland,
Jr.](http://biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland.html) in the
[Department of Biology at the University of California,
Riverside](http://biology.ucr.edu/), studying the effects of exercise
and artificial selection on skeletal morphology and bone mechanics in
house mice.

The Garland Lab has been artificially selecting mice for high levels
of voluntary wheel running for more than 60 generations. These
"high-runner" mice can run more than 25 km in one night, which is
taxing to most physiological systems. In the lab, we are particularly
interested in the effects (both separate and combined) of exercise
and artificial selection on skeletal form, growth, physiology, and
function.

### Inbred High Activity Mini-Muscle Mice

A major project in the lab is the establishment of an inbred strain
of high-activity mice that exhibit the mini-muscle phenotype. This
project was begun in 2007. As of Fall 2014, we are over 20
generations into inbreeding and can now officially say that the
strain is inbred.

The strain of mice that results from the project, which will both
exhibit the mini-muscle allele and have genes enabling them to run
great distances are a potential model organism for human
musculoskeletal diseases and disorders. For example, mice can be
crossed with other strains of mice known to have high or low bone
mass to dissect the complex interaction between muscle function and
normal bone growth.

Future experiments may include physiological measurements such as
maximal oxygen consumption during strenuous exercise. High-runner
mice generally have higher oxygen consumption, but this varies
depending of the presence of the mini-muscle allele. Additionally,
inbreeding may affect the physiological capacity of mice, so
comparisons between the mice described in this experiment and
"regular" high-runner mice will provide insights into the complex
regulation of physiology. Research in the lab also concerns
differences in bone shape and materials between mini-muscle mice and
both high-runner mice and “standard” strains of lab mice.

Comparisons of shape and breaking strength with other types of mice
will help us understand how genetics control the formation and,
ultimately, function of the skeleton. In humans, for instance, it has
been shown that certain bone shapes are more prone to fracture, and
that these shape differences are genetically determined. By studying
the same relationship in a model organism, in which we can have much
greater experimental control, we will be able to better understand
human biology.
