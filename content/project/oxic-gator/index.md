In collaboration with [Dr. James
Hicks](http://compphys.bio.uci.edu/Bio_Sci/Home.html) (UC, Irvine),
Dr. Tomasz Owerkowicz (CSU, San Bernardino), and [Dr. Bryan
Rourke](http://www.csulb.edu/~brourke/CMP_Faculty.htm) (CSU, Long
Beach), we are studying the effects of different oxygen environments
on the growth microstructure of alligator bones. During the last ca.
550 million years, atmospheric oxygen levels have varied when
compared to the present atmospheric oxygen level of 21% (normoxia).

During the Permian, atmospheric oxygen is estimated to have been as
high as 30-35% (hyperoxia) and in the Late Triassic as low as 12%
(hypoxia). Vertebrate have been living and evolving in these variable
conditions. Recent interest in the bone structure of fossil
vertebrate has led to a great expansion comparative paleohistology.
However, comparisons are restricted to animals that live in
present-day, normoxic environments.

By raising alligators in different oxygen environments, first in eggs
and then post-hatching, we will mimic a range of atmospheric
conditions, from hypoxia to hyperoxia. These experiments will allow
us to assess the effects of the prevailing environment on growth
rates and microstructure of bone. We will also be able to provide a
comparative context for future paleohistological studies.
