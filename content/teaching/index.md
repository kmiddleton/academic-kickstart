## Clinical Human Anatomy

My main teaching activity at the University of Missouri is in the MU School of Medicine. I am part of a large group of faculty and graduate trainees who teach first year clinically oriented human anatomy to first-year medical students. In the past I have taught our undergraduate pre-health *Human Anatomy* lecture and lab courses. I was involved in transitioning these large human anatomy lecture and lab courses to a "flipped classroom" format with clinical context.

## Statistical Inference and Data Analysis

I have been teaching statistics and data analysis for life sciences periodically for the last few years. I'm a strong believer in demystifying analysis (particularly using R and/or python) and in teaching students reproducible research. Dr. Elizabeth King (MU Biological Sciences) and I co-developed a graduate course in quantitative methods for life sciences students. It is [freely available online](https://github.com/kmiddleton/quant_methods).

Collaborating with Randall Pruim (Calvin College), I co-developed an R package ([abd](https://github.com/Middleton-Lab/abd)) to accompany the first edition of *The Analysis of Biological Data* by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter.
