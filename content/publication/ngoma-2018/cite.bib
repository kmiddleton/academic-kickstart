  abstract = "The ability to quantify fecundity is critically important to a
              wide range of experimental applications, particularly in
              widely-used model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster.
              However, the standard method of manually counting eggs is time
              consuming and limits the feasibility of large-scale experiments.
              We develop a predictive model to automate the counting of eggs
              from images of eggs removed from the media surface and washed
              onto dark filter paper. Our method uses the simple relationship
              between the white area in an image and the number of eggs present
              to create a predictive model that performs well even at high egg
              densities where clumping can complicate the individual
              identification of eggs. A cross-validation approach demonstrates
              our method performs well, with a correlation between predicted
              and manually counted values of 0.88. We show how this method can
              be applied to a large data set where egg densities vary widely.",
