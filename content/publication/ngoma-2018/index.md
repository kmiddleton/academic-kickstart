abstract: "The ability to quantify fecundity is critically important to a wide range of experimental applications, particularly in widely-used model organisms such as *Drosophila melanogaster*. However, the standard method of manually counting eggs is time consuming and limits the feasibility of large-scale experiments. We develop a predictive model to automate the counting of eggs from images of eggs removed from the media surface and washed onto dark filter paper. A cross-validation approach demonstrates our method performs well, with a correlation between predicted and manually counted values of 0.88. We show how this method can be applied to a large data set where egg densities vary widely."
