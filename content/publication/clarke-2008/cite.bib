  abstract    = "The study of morphological evolution after the inferred origin
                 of active flight homologous with that in Aves has historically
                 been characterized by an emphasis on anatomically disjunct,
                 mosaic patterns of change. Relatively few prior studies have
                 used discrete morphological character data in a phylogenetic
                 context to quantitatively investigate morphological evolution
                 or mosaic evolution in particular. One such previously
                 employed method, which used summed unambiguously optimized
                 synapomorphies, has been the basis for proposing disassociated
                 and sequential ``modernizing'' or ``fine-tuning'' of pectoral
                 and then pelvic locomotor systems after the origin of flight
                 (``pectoral early-pelvic late'' hypothesis). We use one of the
                 most inclusive phylogenetic data sets of basal birds to
                 investigate properties of this method and to consider the
                 application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Bayes factor
                 and statistical comparisons of branch length estimates were
                 used to evaluate support for a mosaic pattern of character
                 change and the specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis.
                 Partitions were defined a priori based on anatomical subregion
                 (e.g., pelvic, pectoral) and were based on those hypothesized
                 using the summed synapomorphy approach. We compare 80 models
                 all implementing the M(k) model for morphological data but
                 varying in the number of anatomical subregion partitions, the
                 models for among-partition rate variation and among-character
                 rate variation, as well as the branch length prior.
                 Statistical analysis reveals that partitioning data by
                 anatomical subregion, independently estimating branch lengths
                 for partitioned data, and use of shared or per partition
                 gamma-shaped among-character rate distribution significantly
                 increases estimated model likelihoods. Simulation studies
                 reveal that partitioned models where characters are randomly
                 assigned perform significantly worse than both the observed
                 model and the single-partition equal-rate model, suggesting
                 that only partitioning by anatomical subregion increases model
                 performance. The preference for models with partitions defined
                 a priori by anatomical subregion is consistent with a
                 disjunctive pattern of character change for the data set
                 investigated and may have implications for parameterization of
                 Bayesian analyses of morphological data more generally.
                 Statistical tests of differences in estimated branch lengths
                 from the pectoral and pelvic partitions do not support the
                 specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis proposed from
                 the summed synapomorphy approach; however, results suggest
                 limited support for some pectoral branch lengths being
                 significantly longer only early at/after the origin of flight.",
