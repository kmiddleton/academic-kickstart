  abstract  = "ABSTRACTDinosauromorphs evolved a wide diversity of hind limb
               skeletal morphologies, suggesting highly divergent articular
               soft tissue anatomies. However, poor preservation of articular
               soft tissues in fossils has hampered any follow-on functional
               inferences. We reconstruct the hip joint soft tissue anatomy of
               non-dinosaurian dinosauromorphs and early dinosaurs using
               osteological correlates derived from extant sauropsids and infer
               trends in character transitions along the theropod and
               sauropodomorph lineagues. Femora and pelves of 107
               dinosauromorphs and outgroup taxa were digitized using 3D
               imaging techniques. Key transitions were estimated using maximum
               likelihood ancestral state reconstruction. The hips of
               dinosauromorphs possessed wide a disparity of soft tissue
               morphologies beyond the types and combinations exhibited by
               extant archosaurs. Early evolution of the dinosauriform hip
               joint was characterized by the retention of a prominent femoral
               hyaline cartilage cone in post-neonatal individuals, with the
               cartilage cone independently reduced within theropods and
               sauropodomorphs. The femur of Dinosauriformes possessed a
               fibrocartilage sleeve on the metaphysis, which surrounded a
               hyaline core. The acetabulum of Dinosauriformes possessed
               distinct labrum and antitrochanter structures. In
               sauropodomorphs, hip congruence was maintained by thick hyaline
               cartilage on the femoral head, whereas theropods relied on
               acetabular tissues such as ligaments and articular pads. In
               particular, the craniolaterally ossified hip capsule of
               non-Avetheropoda neotheropods permitted mostly parasagittal
               femoral movements. These data indicate that the dinosauromorph
               hip underwent mosaic evolution within the saurischian lineage
               and that sauropodomorphs and theropods underwent both
               convergence and divergence in articular soft tissues, correlated
               with transitions in body size, locomotor posture, and joint
