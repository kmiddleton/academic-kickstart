  abstract    = "This study examined the day-to-day variability in voluntary
                 wheel-running behavior among three genetically distinct lines
                 of young male and female mice. Daily wheel revolutions were
                 recorded at an age of 6-8 weeks in 10 males and 10 females
                 from each of 3 lines: selectively bred line for high wheel
                 running (Line 8), selectively bred for high wheel-running
                 activity and fixed for a Mendelian recessive allele that
                 reduces hind-limb muscle mass by 50\% (Line 3), non-selected
                 control (Line 2). There were significant mean differences in
                 revolutions/day among weeks (P = 0.003), but the effect size
                 was small (10\%). Significant main effects for wheel running
                 were also revealed for sex and line (P < 0.001). The grand
                 mean +/- SD for the coefficient of variation (CV) of
                 intra-individual wheel running was 23.0 +/- 10.8\%. Although a
                 significant main effect for the CV was found for week, the
                 effect size was low (7\%) (age 6 weeks, 23.4 +/- 10.9\%; age 7
                 weeks, 25.1 +/- 13.2\%; age 8 weeks, 20.1 +/- 7.8\%). The
                 overall mean CV was similar between females (21.4 +/- 9.8\%)
                 and males (24.4 +/- 12.0\%) and among lines (Line 2, 23.4 +/-
                 9.8\%; Line 3, 20.4 +/- 7.6\%; and Line 8, 25.0 +/- 14.4\%).
                 These findings are consistent with our previous work in young
                 humans and lend further support for the hypothesis that
                 biological mechanisms influence daily levels of physical
                 activity.",
