  abstract    = "Limb bone diaphyseal structure is frequently used to infer
                 hominin activity levels from skeletal remains, an approach
                 based on the well-documented ability of bone to adjust to its
                 loading environment during life. However, diaphyseal structure
                 is also determined in part by genetic factors. This study
                 investigates the possibility that genetic variation underlying
                 diaphyseal structure is influenced by the activity levels of
                 ancestral populations and might also have functional
                 significance in an evolutionary context. We adopted an
                 experimental evolution approach and tested for differences in
                 femoral diaphyseal structure in 1-week-old mice from a line
                 that had been artificially selected (45 generations) for high
                 voluntary wheel running and non-selected controls. As adults,
                 selected mice are significantly more active on wheels and in
                 home cages, and have thicker diaphyses. Structural differences
                 at 1 week can be assumed to primarily reflect the effects of
                 selective breeding rather than direct mechanical stimuli,
                 given that the onset of locomotion in mice is shortly after
                 Day 7. We hypothesized that if genetically determined
                 diaphyseal structure reflects the activity patterns of members
                 of a lineage, then selected animals will have relatively
                 larger diaphyseal dimensions at 1 week compared to controls.
                 The results provide strong support for this hypothesis and
                 suggest that limb bone cross sections may not always only
                 reflect the activity levels of particular fossil individuals,
                 but also convey an evolutionary signal providing information
                 about hominin activity in the past.",
