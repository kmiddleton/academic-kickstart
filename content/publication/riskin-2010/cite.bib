  abstract    = "In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats
                 representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times
                 in body mass (M(b)=0.0278-1.152 kg), to determine whether wing
                 posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted
                 according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind
                 tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor.
                 Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of
                 the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used
                 phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to
                 test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (b(max))
                 and maximum wing area (S(max)) scaled with more positive
                 allometry, and wing loading (Q(s)) with more negative
                 allometry (b(max)∝M(b)(0.423); S(max)∝M(b)(0.768);
                 Q(s)∝M(b)(0.233)) than has been reported in previous studies
                 that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out
                 flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger
                 bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight,
                 and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to
                 predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several
                 kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke
                 amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal
                 number, did not change significantly with body size,
                 demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar
                 across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory
                 suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with
                 mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed
                 with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients
                 (C(L)) than did small bats (C(L)∝M(b)(0.170)). Also, the slope
                 of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was
                 significantly more shallow than expected under isometry
                 (T∝M(b)(0.180)), and angle of attack (α) increased
                 significantly with body mass [α∝log(M(b))7.738]. None of the
                 bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple
                 regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that
                 correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal
                 acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several
                 significant trends that were consistent among species. Our
                 results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the
                 ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce
                 thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are
                 independent of body size.",
