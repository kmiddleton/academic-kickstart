                 frequently used by anthropologists and paleontologists to
                 infer the loading histories of past populations. To address
                 some underlying assumptions, we investigated the relative
                 roles of genetics and exercise on bone cross-sectional
                 geometry and bending mechanics in three mouse strains: high
                 bone density (C3H/He), low bone density (C57BL/6), and a
                 high-runner strain homozygous for the Myh4Minimscallele (MM).
                 METHODS AND MATERIALS: Weanlings of each strain were divided
                 into exercise (wheel) or control (sedentary) treatment groups
                 for a 7-week experimental period. Morphometrics of the femoral
                 mid-diaphysis and mechanical testing were used to assess both
                 theoretical and ex vivo bending mechanics. RESULTS: Across all
                 measured morphological and bending traits, we found relatively
                 small effects of exercise treatment compared to larger and
                 more frequent interstrain differences. In the exercised group,
                 total distance run over the experimental period was not a
                 predictor of any morphological or bending traits.
                 Cross-sectional geometry did not accurately predict bone
                 response to loading. DISCUSSION: Results from this
                 experimental model do not support hypothesized associations
                 among extreme exercise, cross-sectional geometry, and bending
                 mechanics. Our results suggest that analysis of
                 cross-sectional geometry alone is insufficient to predict
                 loading response, and questions the common assumption that
                 cross-sectional geometry differences are indicative of
                 differential loading history.",
