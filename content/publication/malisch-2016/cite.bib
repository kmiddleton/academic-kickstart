  abstract    = "In vertebrates, acute stressors-although short in duration-can
                 influence physiology and behavior over a longer time course,
                 which might have important ramifications under natural
                 conditions. In laboratory rats, for example, acute stress has
                 been shown to increase anxiogenic behaviors for days after a
                 stressor. In this study, we quantified voluntary wheel-running
                 behavior for 22 h following a restraint stress and
                 glucocorticoid levels 24 h postrestraint. We utilized mice
                 from four replicate lines that have been selectively bred for
                 high voluntary wheel-running activity (HR mice) for 60
                 generations and their nonselected control (C) lines to examine
                 potential interactions between exercise propensity and
                 sensitivity to stress. Following 6 d of wheel access on a
                 12L∶12D photo cycle (0700-1900 hours, as during the routine
                 selective breeding protocol), 80 mice were physically
                 restrained for 40 min, beginning at 1400 hours, while another
                 80 were left undisturbed. Relative to unrestrained mice, wheel
                 running increased for both HR and C mice during the first hour
                 postrestraint (P < 0.0001) but did not differ 2 or 3 h
                 postrestraint. Wheel running was also examined at four
                 distinct phases of the photoperiod. Running in the period of
                 1600-1840 hours was unaffected by restraint stress and did not
                 differ statistically between HR and C mice. During the period
                 of peak wheel running (1920-0140 hours), restrained mice
                 tended to run fewer revolutions (-11\%; two-tailed P =
                 0.0733), while HR mice ran 473\% more than C (P = 0.0008),
                 with no restraint × line type interaction. Wheel running
                 declined for all mice in the latter part of the scotophase
                 (0140-0600 hours), restraint had no statistical effect on
                 wheel running, but HR again ran more than C (+467\%; P =
                 0.0122). Finally, during the start of the photophase
                 (0720-1200 hours), restraint increased running by an average
                 of 53\% (P = 0.0443) in both line types, but HR and C mice did
                 not differ statistically. Mice from HR lines had statistically
                 higher plasma corticosterone concentrations than C mice, with
                 no statistical effect of restraint and no interaction between
                 line type and restraint. Overall, these results indicate that
                 acute stress can affect locomotor activity (or activity
                 patterns) for many hours, with the most prominent effect being
                 an increase in activity during a period of typical inactivity
                 at the start of the photophase, 15-20 h poststressor.",
