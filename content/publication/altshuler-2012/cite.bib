  abstract    = "The biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms used by
                 different animals to generate turns in flight are highly
                 variable. Body size and body plan exert some influence, e.g.
                 birds typically roll their body to orient forces generated by
                 the wings whereas insects are capable of turning via
                 left-right wingbeat asymmetries. Turns are also relatively
                 brief and have low repeatability, with almost every wingbeat
                 serving a different function throughout the change in heading.
                 Here we present an analysis of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte
                 anna) as they fed continuously from an artificial feeder
                 revolving around the outside of the animal. This setup allowed
                 for examination of sustained changes in yaw without requiring
                 any corresponding changes in pitch, roll or body position.
                 Hummingbirds sustained yaw turns by expanding the wing stroke
                 amplitude of the outer wing during the downstroke and by
                 altering the deviation of the wingtip path during both
                 downstroke and upstroke. The latter led to a shift in the
                 inner-outer stroke plane angle during the upstroke and shifts
                 in the elevation of the stroke plane and in the deviation of
                 the wingtip path during both strokes. These features are
                 generally more similar to how insects, as opposed to birds,
                 turn. However, time series analysis also revealed considerable
                 stroke-to-stroke variation. Changes in the stroke amplitude
                 and the wingtip velocity were highly cross-correlated, as were
                 changes in the stroke deviation and the elevation of the
                 stroke plane. As was the case for wingbeat kinematics,
                 electromyogram recordings from pectoral and wing muscles were
                 highly variable, but no correlations were found between these
                 two features of motor control. The high variability of both
                 kinematic and muscle activation features indicates a high
                 level of wingbeat-to-wingbeat adjustments during sustained
                 yaw. The activation timing of the muscles was more repeatable
                 than the activation intensity, which suggests that the former
                 may be constrained by harmonic motion and that the latter may
                 play a large role in kinematic adjustments. Comparing the
                 revolution frequency of the feeder with measurements of free
                 flight yaws reveals that feeder tracking, even at one
                 revolution every 2 s, is well below the maximum yaw capacity
                 of the hummingbirds.",
