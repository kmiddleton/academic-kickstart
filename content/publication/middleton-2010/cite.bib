  abstract    = "The hierarchical structure of bone, involving micro-scale
                 organization and interaction of material components, is a
                 critical determinant of macro-scale mechanics. Changes in
                 whole-bone morphology in response to the actions of individual
                 genes, physiological loading during life, or evolutionary
                 processes, may be accompanied by alterations in underlying
                 mineralization or architecture. Here, we used nanoindentation
                 to precisely measure compressive stiffness in the femoral
                 mid-diaphysis of mice that had experienced 37 generations of
                 selective breeding for high levels of voluntary wheel running
                 (HR). Mice (n = 48 total), half from HR lines and half from
                 non-selected control (C) lines, were divided into two
                 experimental groups, one with 13-14 weeks of access to a
                 running wheel and one housed without wheels (n = 12 in each
                 group). At the end of the experiment, gross and micro-computed
                 tomography (microCT)-based morphometric traits were measured,
                 and reduced elastic modulus (E(r)) was estimated separately
                 for four anatomical quadrants of the femoral cortex: anterior,
                 posterior, lateral, and medial. Two-way, mixed-model analysis
                 of covariance (ancova) showed that body mass was a highly
                 significant predictor of all morphometric traits and that
                 structural change is more apparent at the microCT level than
                 in conventional morphometrics of whole bones. Both line type
                 (HR vs. C) and presence of the mini-muscle phenotype (caused
                 by a Mendelian recessive allele and characterized by a
                 approximately 50\% reduction in mass of the gastrocnemius
                 muscle complex) were significant predictors of femoral
                 cortical cross-sectional anatomy. Measurement of reduced
                 modulus obtained by nanoindentation was repeatable within a
                 single quadrant and sensitive enough to detect
                 inter-individual differences. Although we found no significant
                 effects of line type (HR vs. C) or physical activity (wheel
                 vs. no wheel) on mean stiffness, anterior and posterior
                 quadrants were significantly stiffer (P < 0.0001) than medial
                 and lateral quadrants (32.67 and 33.09 GPa vs. 29.78 and 30.46
                 GPa, respectively). Our findings of no significant difference
                 in compressive stiffness in the anterior and posterior
                 quadrants agree with previous results for mice, but differ
                 from those for large mammals. Integrating these results with
                 others from ongoing research on these mice, we hypothesize
                 that the skeletons of female HR mice may be less sensitive to
                 the effects of chronic exercise, due to decreased circulating
                 leptin levels and potentially altered endocannabinoid
                 signaling.",
