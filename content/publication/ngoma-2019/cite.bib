  abstract = "The nutritional conditions experienced by a population have a
              major role in shaping trait evolution in many taxa. Constraints
              exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient imbalance can
              influence the maximal value that fitness components such as
              reproduction and lifespan attains, and organisms may shift how
              resources are allocated to different structures and functions in
              response to changes in nutrition. Whether the phenotypic changes
              associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive
              response is largely unknown. Further, it is unclear whether the
              response of fitness components to diet even has the potential to
              evolve in most systems. In this study, we use an admixed
              multi-parental population of Drosophila melanogaster reared in
              three different diet conditions to estimate quantitative genetic
              parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We find significant
              genetic variation for both traits in our population and show that
              lifespan has moderate to high heritabilities within diets.
              Genetic correlations for lifespan between diets were
              significantly less than one, demonstrating a strong genotype by
              diet interaction. These findings demonstrate substantial standing
              genetic variation in our population that is comparable to natural
              populations and highlights the potential for adaptation to
              changing nutritional environments.",
