  abstract = "Understanding how refugees integrate into host societies has
              broad implications for researchers interested in intergroup
              conflict and for governments concerned with promoting social
              cohesion. Using detailed records tracking the movements and life
              histories of Finnish evacuees during World War II, we find that
              evacuees who intermarry are more likely to be educated, work in
              professional occupations, marry someone higher in social status
              and remain in the host community. Evacuees who intermarry before
              the war have fewer children, whereas those who marry into their
              host community after the war have more children. These results
              indicate that life-history and assimilation outcomes depend on
              key differences between pre-war environments-when migrants are
              living in their own communities-and post-war environments-when
              migrants are living in the host community. Overall, this suggests
              that integration involves a trade-off between reproduction and
              status such that evacuees who integrate gain social status,
              whereas those who maintain stronger bonds with their natal
              communities have higher fertility. We discuss these results
              within the framework of social capital, intergroup conflict and
              life-history theory and suggest how they can inform our
              understanding of evolutionary adaptations that affect tribalism.",
