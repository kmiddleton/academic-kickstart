  abstract    = "The perching foot of living birds is commonly characterized by
                 a reversed or opposable digit I (hallux). Primitively, the
                 hallux of nonavian theropod dinosaurs was unreversed and lay
                 parallel to digits II-IV. Among basal birds, a unique digital
                 innovation evolved in which the hallux opposes digits II-IV.
                 This digital configuration is critical for grasping and
                 perching. I studied skeletons of modern birds with a range of
                 hallucal designs, from unreversed (anteromedially directed) to
                 fully reversed (posteriorly directed). Two primary correlates
                 of hallucal orientation were revealed. First, the fossa into
                 which metatarsal I articulates is oriented slightly more
                 posteriorly on the tarsometatarsus, rotating the digit as a
                 unit. Second, metatarsal I exhibits a distinctive torsion of
                 its distal shaft relative to its proximal articulation with
                 the tarsometatarsus, reorienting the distal condyles and
                 phalanges of digit I. Herein, I present a method that
                 facilitates the re-evaluation of hallucal orientation in
                 fossil avians based on morphology alone. This method also
                 avoids potential misinterpretations of hallucal orientation in
                 fossil birds that could result from preserved appearance
                 alone.",
