  abstract    = "Three-dimensional computational modeling offers tools with
                 which to investigate forces experienced by the skull during
                 feeding and other behaviors. American alligators (Alligator
                 mississippiensis) generate some of the highest measured bite
                 forces among extant tetrapods. A concomitant increase in bite
                 force accompanies ontogenetic increases in body mass, which
                 has been linked with dietary changes as animals increase in
                 size. Because the flattened skull of crocodylians has
                 substantial mediolaterally oriented muscles, crocodylians are
                 an excellent model taxon in which to explore the role of
                 mediolateral force components experienced by the feeding
                 apparatus. Many previous modeling studies of archosaur cranial
                 function focused on planar analysis, ignoring the mediolateral
                 aspects of cranial forces. Here, we used three-dimensionally
                 accurate anatomical data to resolve 3D muscle forces. Using
                 dissection, imaging and computational techniques, we developed
                 lever and finite element models of an ontogenetic series of
                 alligators to test the effects of size and shape on cranial
                 loading and compared estimated bite forces with those
                 previously measured in vivo in A. mississippiensis We found
                 that modeled forces matched in vivo data well for
                 intermediately sized individuals, and somewhat overestimated
                 force in smaller specimens and underestimated force in larger
                 specimens, suggesting that ontogenetically static muscular
                 parameters and bony attachment sites alone cannot account for
                 all the variation in bite force. Adding aponeurotic muscle
                 attachments would likely improve force predictions, but such
                 data are challenging to model and integrate into analyses of
                 extant taxa and are generally unpreserved in fossils. We
                 conclude that anatomically accurate modeling of muscles can be
                 coupled with finite element and lever analyses to produce
                 reliable, reasonably accurate estimate bite forces and thus
                 both skeletal and joint loading, with known sources of error,
                 which can be applied to extinct taxa.",
