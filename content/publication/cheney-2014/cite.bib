  abstract    = "Unlike flapping birds and insects, bats possess membrane wings
                 that are more similar to many gliding mammals. The vast
                 majority of the wing is composed of a thin compliant skin
                 membrane stretched between the limbs, hand, and body. Membrane
                 wings are of particular interest because they may offer many
                 advantages to micro air vehicles. One critical feature of
                 membrane wings is that they camber passively in response to
                 aerodynamic load, potentially allowing for simplified wing
                 control. However, for maximum membrane wing performance,
                 tuning of the membrane structure to aerodynamic conditions is
                 necessary. Bats possess an array of muscles, the
                 plagiopatagiales proprii, embedded within the wing membrane
                 that could serve to tune membrane stiffness, or may have
                 alternative functions. We recorded the electromyogram from the
                 plagiopatagiales proprii muscles of Artibeus jamaicensis, the
                 Jamaican fruit bat, in flight at two different speeds and
                 found that these muscles were active during downstroke. For
                 both low- and high-speed flight, muscle activity increased
                 between late upstroke and early downstroke and decreased at
                 late downstroke. Thus, the array of plagiopatagiales may
                 provide a mechanism for bats to increase wing stiffness and
                 thereby reduce passive membrane deformation. These muscles
                 also activate in synchrony, presumably as a means to maximize
                 force generation, because each muscle is small and, by
                 estimation, weak. Small differences in activation timing were
                 observed when comparing low- and high-speed flight, which may
                 indicate that bats modulate membrane stiffness differently
                 depending on flight speed.",
