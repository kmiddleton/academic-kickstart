  abstract    = "Exercise is a naturally rewarding behaviour in human beings
                 and can be associated with feelings of euphoria and analgesia.
                 The endocannabinoid system may play a role in the perception
                 of neurobiological rewards during and after prolonged
                 exercise. Mice from lines that have been selectively bred for
                 high voluntary wheel running (high runner or HR lines) may
                 have evolved neurobiological mechanisms that increase the
                 incentive salience of endurance-type exercise. Here, we test
                 the hypothesis that endocannabinoid signalling has been
                 altered in the four replicate HR lines as compared with four
                 nonselected control lines. After 18 days of acclimation to
                 cages with attached wheels, we injected mice with rimonabant
                 (SR141716), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist.
                 During the time of normal peak running, each mouse received,
                 in a randomized order, intraperitoneal injection of rimonabant
                 (0.1 or 3.0 mg/kg) or vehicle, over 9 days. Drug response was
                 quantified as wheel revolutions, time and speed 10-70 min
                 postinjection. Rimonabant decreased running in all mice;
                 however, female HR mice differentially decreased running speed
                 and distance (but not time) as compared with control females.
                 We conclude that altered endocannabinoid signalling plays a
                 role in the high wheel running of female HR mice.",
