  abstract    = "ABSTRACT The evolution of theropod flight has been
                 characterized as a shift from one to three locomotor modules.
                 Basal theropods, which were terrestrial bipeds, had a single
                 locomotor module composed of the hind limb and tail. In birds,
                 aerial locomotion was acquired with the origination of the
                 wing module and a decoupling of the hind limb and tail into
                 separate pelvic and caudal modules. This increase in
                 modularity is thought to have granted birds more locomotor
                 ?options? than non-avian theropods. More specifically, an
                 aerial locomotor system could have eased constraints on the
                 hind limb and allowed specialization for habitats and
                 lifestyles unavailable to non-birds. If so, bird hind limbs
                 should be more disparate than those of non-avian theropods. We
                 addressed this hypothesis by visualizing one aspect of limb
                 design, the proportions of the three main segments, using
                 ternary diagrams. Our results show that avian hind limb
                 proportions are much more disparate than those of non-avian
                 theropods. This broad range of limb design correlates with a
                 radiation in locomotor diversity founded on three locomotor
                 modules. We propose that birds have reached regions of
                 proportion morphospace that are off limits to bipeds with only
                 one locomotor module. In comparison, the limbs of non-avian
                 theropods are conservatively proportioned. Despite great
                 variation in body size, theropods other than birds do not
                 exhibit specializations for locomotion other than terrestrial
                 bipedalism. Although other aspects of size and shape need to
                 be analyzed, the relationship between modular flexibility and
                 morphological disparity appears to play an important role in
                 theropod locomotor evolution.",
