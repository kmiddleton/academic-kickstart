                 must monitor and respond to changing conditions and
                 unpredictable situations. Using information from multiple
                 sensory systems allows them to modify their behavior in
                 response to their dynamic environment but also creates the
                 challenge of integrating different, and potentially
                 contradictory, sources of information for behavior control.
                 Understanding how multiple information streams are integrated
                 to produce flexible and reliable behavior is key to
                 understanding how behavior is controlled in natural settings.
                 Natural settings are rarely still, which challenges animals
                 that require precise body position control, like hummingbirds,
                 which hover while feeding from flowers. Tactile feedback,
                 available only once the hummingbird is docked at the flower,
                 could provide additional information to help maintain its
                 position at the flower. To investigate the role of tactile
                 information for hovering control during feeding, we first
                 asked whether hummingbirds physically interact with a feeder
                 once docked. We quantified physical interactions between
                 docked hummingbirds and a feeder placed in front of a
                 stationary background pattern. Force sensors on the feeder
                 measured a complex time course of loading that reflects the
                 wingbeat frequency and bill movement of feeding hummingbirds,
                 and suggests that they sometimes push against the feeder with
                 their bill. Next, we asked whether the measured tactile
                 interactions were used by feeding hummingbirds to maintain
                 position relative to the feeder. We created two experimental
                 scenarios â€“ one in which the feeder was stationary and the
                 visual background moved and the other where the feeder moved
                 laterally in front of a white background. When the visual
                 background pattern moved, docked hummingbirds pushed
                 significantly harder in the direction of horizontal visual
                 motion. When the feeder moved, and the background was
                 stationary, hummingbirds generated aerodynamic force in the
                 opposite direction of the feeder motion. These results suggest
                 that docked hummingbirds are using visual information about
                 the environment to maintain body position and orientation, and
                 not actively tracking the motion of the feeder. The absence of
                 flower tracking behavior in hummingbirds contrasts with the
                 behavior of hawkmoths, and provides evidence that they rely
                 primarily on the visual background rather than flower-based
                 cues while feeding.",
