  abstract    = "We examined the relationship between forelimb design and
                 function across the 230-million-year history of theropod
                 evolution. Forelimb disparity was assessed by plotting the
                 relative contributions of the three main limb elements on a
                 ternary diagram. Theropods were divided into five functional
                 groups: predatory, reduced, flying, wing-propelled diving, and
                 flighdess. Forelimbs which maintained their primitive
                 function, predation, are similarly proportioned, but non-avian
                 theropods with highly reduced forelimbs have relatively longer
                 humeri. Despite the dramatically different forces imparted by
                 the evolution of flight, forelimb proportions of basal birds
                 are only slighdy different from those of their non-avian
                 relatives. An increase in disparity accompanied the subsequent
                 radiation of birds. Each transition to flightlessness has been
                 accompanied by an increase in relative humeral length, which
                 results from relatively short distal limb elements. We
                 introduce theoretical predictions based on five biomechanical
                 and developmental factors that may have influenced the
                 evolution of theropod limb proportions.",
