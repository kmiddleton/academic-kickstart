  abstract    = "Both genetic and environmental factors are known to influence
                 the structure of bone, contributing to its mechanical behavior
                 during, and adaptive response to, loading. We introduce a
                 novel approach to simultaneously address the genetically
                 mediated, exercise-related effects on bone morphometrics and
                 strength, using mice that had been selectively bred for high
                 levels of voluntary wheel running (16 generations). Female
                 mice from high running and control lines were either allowed
                 (n=12, 12, respectively) or denied (n=11, 12, respectively)
                 access to wheels for 20 months. Femoral shaft, neck, and head
                 were measured with calipers and via micro-computed tomography.
                 Fracture characteristics of the femoral head were assessed in
                 cantilever bending. After adjusting for variation in body mass
                 by two-way analysis of covariance, distal width of the femur
                 increased as a result of selective breeding, and mediolateral
                 femoral diameter was reduced by wheel access. Cross-sectional
                 area of the femoral mid-shaft showed a significant linetype x
                 activity effect, increasing with wheel access in high-running
                 lines but decreasing in control lines. Body mass was
                 significantly positively correlated with many of the
                 morphometric traits studied. Fracture load of the femoral neck
                 was strongly positively predicted by morphometric traits of
                 the femoral neck (r2>0.30), but no significant effects of
                 selective breeding or wheel access were found. The significant
                 correlations of body mass with femoral morphometric traits
                 underscore the importance of controlling for body size when
                 analyzing the response of bone size and shape to experimental
                 treatments. After controlling for body mass, measures of the
                 femoral neck remain significant predictors of femoral neck
                 strength.",
