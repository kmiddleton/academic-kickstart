  abstract    = "We present a novel mouse-model for the study of skeletal
                 structure and evolution, based on selective breeding for high
                 levels of voluntary wheel running. Whereas traditional models
                 (originally inbred strains, more recently knockouts and
                 transgenics) rely on the study of mutant or
                 laboratory-manipulated phenotypes, we have studied changes in
                 skeletal morphometrics resulting from many generations of
                 artificial selection for high activity in the form of wheel
                 running, in which mice engage voluntarily. Mice from the four
                 replicate High Runner (HR) lines run nearly three times as
                 many revolutions during days 5 and 6 of a 6-day exposure to
                 wheels (1.12 m circumference). We have found significant
                 changes in skeletal dimensions of the hind limbs, including
                 decreased directional asymmetry, larger femoral heads, and
                 wider distal femora. The latter two have been hypothesized as
                 evolutionary adaptations for long-distance locomotion in
                 hominids. Exercise-training studies involving experimental
                 groups with and without access to wheels have shown increased
                 diameters of both femora and tibiafibulae, and suggest genetic
                 effects on trainability (genotype-by-environment
                 interactions). Reanalysis of previously published data on bone
                 masses of hind limbs revealed novel patterns of change in bone
                 mass associated with access to wheels for 2 months. Without
                 access to wheels, HR mice have significantly heavier
                 tibiafibulae and foot bones, whereas with chronic access to
                 wheels, a significant increase in foot bone mass that was
                 linearly related to increases in daily wheel running was
                 observed. Mice exhibiting a recently discovered small-muscle
                 phenotype (``mini-muscle,'' [MM] caused by a Mendelian
                 recessive gene), in which the mass of the triceps surae muscle
                 complex is âˆ¼50\% lower than in normal individuals, have
                 significantly longer and thinner bones in the hind limb. We
                 present new data for the ontogenetic development of muscle
                 mass in Control, HR, and MM phenotypes in mice of 1-7 weeks
                 postnatal age. Statistical comparisons reveal highly
                 significant differences both in triceps surae mass and
                 mass-corrected triceps surae mass between normal and MM mice
                 at all but the postnatal age of 1 week. Based on previously
                 observed differences in distributions of myosin isoforms in
                 adult MM mice, we hypothesize that a reduction of myosin
                 heavy-chain type-IIb isoforms with accounts for our observed
                 ontogenetic changes in muscle mass.",
