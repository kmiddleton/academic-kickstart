                 specialized for flight, reflecting both evolutionary history
                 and the need to maintain structural integrity while generating
                 aerodynamic forces. METHODS: We analyzed the anatomical
                 structure of bat wing skeletons in the context of scaling
                 patterns relative to other mammals, material properties and
                 the mechanical function of the wing bones during flight.
                 RESULTS: Compared with nonvolant mammals, the bones of the bat
                 forelimb are elongated, even after correcting for shared
                 phylogenetic history. Bats have consistently larger-diameter
                 bones in the forelimb than do nonvolant mammals but
                 significantly narrower hindlimb bones. Mineralization in the
                 cortical bone of wings is lower than in the long bones of
                 other adult mammals, with a proximodistal gradient of
                 decreasing mineralization. The distal phalanges have only a
                 small amount of mineralized tissue underlying the articular
                 cartilage. Loads required to elicit a 10\% length deflection
                 in the wing bones of Glossophaga soricina varied approximately
                 50-fold along the wing and flexural stiffness nearly 200-fold.
                 Commensurate with low mineralization and flexural stiffness,
                 bat bones experience extraordinarily high bending strains
                 during flight. CONCLUSION: Bat limb skeletons share features
                 with other mammals and possess specialized characteristics,
                 mostly related to the mechanical demands of flight.",
