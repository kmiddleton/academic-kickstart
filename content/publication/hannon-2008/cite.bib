  abstract    = "From outbred Hsd:ICR mice, we selectively bred 4 replicate
                 lines for high running (High-Runner [HR] lines) on wheels
                 while maintaining 4 nonselected lines as controls (C lines).
                 An apparent Mendelian recessive, the ``mini-muscle'' (MM)
                 allele, whose main phenotypic effect is to reduce hindlimb
                 muscle mass by 50\%, was discovered in 2 HR lines and 1 C
                 line. This gene of major effect has gone to fixation in one
                 selected line, remains polymorphic in another, and is now
                 undetectable in the one C line. Homozygotes exhibit various
                 pleiotropic effects, including a doubling of mass-specific
                 muscle aerobic capacity, and larger hearts, livers, and
                 spleens. To create a population suitable for mapping the
                 genomic location of the MM allele and to better characterize
                 its pleiotropic effects, we crossed females fixed for the MM
                 allele with male C57BL/6J. F(1) males were then backcrossed to
                 the MM parent females. Backcross (BC) mice (N = 404) were
                 dissected, and a 50:50 ratio of normal to MM phenotype was
                 observed with no overlap in relative muscle mass. In the BC,
                 analysis of covariance revealed that MM individuals ran
                 significantly more on days 5 and 6 of a 6-day exposure to
                 running wheels (as in the routine selective-breeding
                 protocol), were smaller in body mass, and had larger
                 ventricles and spleens.",
