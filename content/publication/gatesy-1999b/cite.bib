                 posture, gait and speed6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, but most prints,
                 being shallow impressions of a foot's plantar surface, provide
                 little evidence of the details of limb excursion. Here we
                 describe Late Triassic trackways from East Greenland, made by
                 theropods walking on substrates of different consistency and
                 sinking to variable depths, that preserve three-dimensional
                 records of foot movement. Triassic theropod prints share many
                 features with those of ground-dwelling birds, but also
                 demonstrate significant functional differences in position of
                 the hallux (digit I), foot posture and hindlimb excursion.",
