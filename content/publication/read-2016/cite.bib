  abstract    = "Turning in flight requires reorientation of force, which
                 birds, bats and insects accomplish either by shifting body
                 position and total force in concert or by using left-right
                 asymmetries in wingbeat kinematics. Although both mechanisms
                 have been observed in multiple species, it is currently
                 unknown how each is used to control changes in trajectory. We
                 addressed this problem by measuring body and wingbeat
                 kinematics as hummingbirds tracked a revolving feeder, and
                 estimating aerodynamic forces using a quasi-steady model.
                 During arcing turns, hummingbirds symmetrically banked the
                 stroke plane of both wings, and the body, into turns,
                 supporting a body-dependent mechanism. However, several
                 wingbeat asymmetries were present during turning, including a
                 higher and flatter outer wingtip path and a lower more
                 deviated inner wingtip path. A quasi-steady analysis of arcing
                 turns performed with different trajectories revealed that
                 changes in radius were associated with asymmetrical kinematics
                 and forces, and changes in velocity were associated with
                 symmetrical kinematics and forces. Collectively, our results
                 indicate that both body-dependent and -independent force
                 orientation mechanisms are available to hummingbirds, and that
                 these kinematic strategies are used to meet the separate
                 aerodynamic challenges posed by changes in velocity and
                 turning radius.",
