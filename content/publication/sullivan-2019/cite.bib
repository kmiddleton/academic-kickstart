  abstract  = "Avian flight is achieved through a number of modifications to
               the body, including the pectoral girdle, yet little is known
               about the architecture of the pectoral musculature. Muscle
               architecture is a critical variable in determining the
               biomechanical function of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system;
               however, accurate three-dimensional (3D) understanding of muscle
               architecture has been historically difficult to acquire. Here,
               we present a musculoskeletal model of a European starling
               (Sturnus vulgaris) pectoral girdle generated from iodine
               contrast-enhanced micro-computed-tomography (CT) data and 3D
               fiber tracking analysis. We used a template-based fiber-tracking
               algorithm to reconstruct muscle fibers in 3D based on grayscale
               differences in CT images, which allowed us to estimate fascicle
               lengths, pennation angles, muscle volumes, and physiological
               cross-sectional area. Our modeled muscles were qualitatively
               accurate; however, quantitative muscle architecture data
               differed between digital and traditional gross-dissection
               methods reflecting the complex organization of the tissue and
               differing natures of data collection. We found that model
               quality is affected by the resolution of CT image data and the
               fiber-tracking program's input parameters. Nonetheless, digital
               fiber tracking offers numerous advantages over gross-dissection
               methods, most importantly, the ability to visualize and quantify
               entire muscles in three-dimensions, yielding a much more
               accurate estimation of whole muscle architecture.",
