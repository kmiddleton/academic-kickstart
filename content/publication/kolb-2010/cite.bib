  abstract    = "Voluntary activity is a complex trait, comprising both
                 behavioral (motivation, reward) and anatomical/physiological
                 (ability) elements. In the present study, oxygen transport was
                 investigated as a possible limitation to further increases in
                 running by four replicate lines of mice that have been
                 selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running and have
                 reached an apparent selection limit. To increase oxygen
                 transport capacity, erythrocyte density was elevated by the
                 administration of an erythropoietin (EPO) analogue. Mice were
                 given two EPO injections, two days apart, at one of two dose
                 levels (100 or 300 microg kg(-1)). Hemoglobin concentration
                 ([Hb]), maximal aerobic capacity during forced treadmill
                 exercise (VO2,max) and voluntary wheel running were measured.
                 [Hb] did not differ between high runner (HR) and non-selected
                 control (C) lines without EPO treatment. Both doses of EPO
                 significantly (P<0.0001) increased [Hb] as compared with
                 sham-injected animals, with no difference in [Hb] between the
                 100 microg kg(-1) and 300 microg kg(-1) dose levels (overall
                 mean of 4.5 g dl(-1) increase). EPO treatment significantly
                 increased VO2,max by approximately 5\% in both the HR and C
                 lines, with no dose x line type interaction. However, wheel
                 running (revolutions per day) did not increase with EPO
                 treatment in either the HR or C lines, and in fact
                 significantly decreased at the higher dose in both line types.
                 These results suggest that neither [Hb] per se nor VO2,max is
                 limiting voluntary wheel running in the HR lines. Moreover, we
                 hypothesize that the decrease in wheel running at the higher
                 dose of EPO may reflect direct action on the reward pathway of
                 the brain.",
