  abstract = "The extinct nonavian dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex, considered one
              of the hardest biting animals ever, is often hypothesized to have
              exhibited cranial kinesis, or, mobility of cranial joints
              relative to the braincase. Cranial kinesis in T. rex is a
              biomechanical paradox in that forcefully biting tetrapods usually
              possess rigid skulls instead of skulls with movable joints. We
              tested the biomechanical performance of a tyrannosaur skull using
              a series of static positions mimicking possible excursions of the
              palate to evaluate Postural Kinetic Competency in Tyrannosaurus.
              A functional extant phylogenetic bracket was employed using taxa,
              which exhibit measurable palatal excursions: Psittacus erithacus
              (fore-aft movement) and Gekko gecko (mediolateral movement).
              Static finite element models of Psittacus, Gekko, and
              Tyrannosaurus were constructed and tested with different palatal
              postures using anatomically informed material properties, loaded
              with muscle forces derived from dissection, phylogenetic
              bracketing, and a sensitivity analysis of muscle architecture and
              tested in orthal biting simulations using element strain as a
              proxy for model performance. Extant species models showed lower
              strains in naturally occurring postures compared to alternatives.
              We found that fore-aft and neutral models of Tyrannosaurus
              experienced lower overall strains than mediolaterally shifted
              models. Protractor muscles dampened palatal strains, while
              occipital constraints increased strains about palatocranial
              joints compared to jaw joint constraints. These loading behaviors
              suggest that even small excursions can strain elements beyond
              structural failure. Thus, these postural tests of kinesis, along
              with the robusticity of other cranial features, suggest that the
              skull of Tyrannosaurus was functionally akinetic. Anat Rec, 2019.
