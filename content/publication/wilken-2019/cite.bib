  abstract = "Numerous vertebrates exhibit cranial kinesis, or movement between
              bones of the skull and mandible other than at the jaw joint. Many
              kinetic species possess a particular suite of features to
              accomplish this movement, including flexible cranial joints and
              protractor musculature. Whereas the musculoskeletal anatomy of
              these kinetic systems is well understood, how these joints are
              biomechanically loaded, how different soft tissues affect joint
              loading and kinetic capacity, and how the protractor musculature
              loads the skull remain poorly understood. Here, we present a
              finite element model of the savannah monitor, Varanus
              exanthematicus, a modestly kinetic lizard, to better elucidate
              the roles of soft tissue in mobile joints and protractor
              musculature in cranial loading. We describe the 3D resultants of
              jaw muscles and the histology of palatobasal, otic and jaw
              joints. We tested the effects of joint tissue type, bite point
              and muscle load to evaluate the biomechanical role of muscles on
              the palate and braincase. We found that the jaw muscles have
              significant mediolateral components that can impart stability
              across palatocranial joints. Articular tissues affect the
              magnitude of strains experienced around the palatobasal and otic
              joints. Without protractor muscle loading, the palate, quadrate
              and braincase experience higher strains, suggesting this muscle
              helps insulate the braincase and palatoquadrate from high loads.
              We found that the cross-sectional properties of the bones of V.
              exanthematicus are well suited for performing under torsional
              loads. These findings suggest that torsional loading regimes may
              have played a more important role in the evolution of cranial
              kinesis in lepidosaurs than previously appreciated.",
