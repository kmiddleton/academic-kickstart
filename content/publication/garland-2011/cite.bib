  abstract    = "The response to uniform selection may occur in alternate ways
                 that result in similar performance. We tested for multiple
                 adaptive solutions during artificial selection for high
                 voluntary wheel running in laboratory mice. At generation 43,
                 the four replicate high runner (HR) lines averaged 2.85-fold
                 more revolutions per day as compared with four non-selected
                 control (C) lines, and females ran 1.11-fold more than males,
                 with no sex-by-linetype interaction. Analysis of variance
                 indicated significant differences among C lines but not among
                 HR for revolutions per day. By contrast, average speed varied
                 significantly among HR lines, but not among C, and showed a
                 sex-by-linetype interaction, with the HR/C ratio being 2.02
                 for males and 2.45 for females. Time spent running varied
                 among both HR and C lines, and showed a sex-by-linetype
                 interaction, with the HR/C ratio being 1.52 for males but only
                 1.17 for females. Thus, females (speed) and males (speed, but
                 also time) evolved differently, as did the replicate selected
                 lines. Speed and time showed a trade-off among HR but not
                 among C lines. These results demonstrate that uniform
                 selection on a complex trait can cause consistent responses in
                 the trait under direct selection while promoting divergence in
                 the lower-level components of that trait.",
