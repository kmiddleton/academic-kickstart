                 are presented, including kinematic analysis of high-speed
                 stereo videography of straight and turning flight, and
                 measurements of the wake velocity field behind the bat. The
                 kinematic data reveal that, at relatively slow flight speeds,
                 wing motion is quite complex, including a sharp retraction of
                 the wing during the upstroke and a broad sweep of the
                 partially extended wing during the downstroke. The data also
                 indicate that the flight speed and elevation are not constant,
                 but oscillate in synchrony with both the horizontal and
                 vertical movements of the wing. PIV measurements in the
                 transverse (Trefftz) plane of the wake indicate a complex
                 'wake vortex' structure dominated by a strong wing tip vortex
                 shed from the wing tip during the downstroke and either the
                 wing tip or a more proximal joint during the upstroke. Data
                 synthesis of several discrete realizations suggests a
                 'cartoon' of the wake structure during the entire wing beat
                 cycle. Considerable work remains to be done to confirm and
                 amplify these results.",
