  abstract    = "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in regulation of
                 various physiological functions, including locomotion,
                 antinociception, emotional states, and motivated behaviors.
                 The ECS has been implicated in regulation of voluntary wheel
                 running in mice via actions at the cannabinoid receptor-1
                 (CB1). Previously, we showed that four replicate lines of mice
                 bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running (high-runner
                 or HR lines) sex-specifically (females only) decreased running
                 in response to antagonism of the CB1 receptor, as compared
                 with four unselected Control lines. Here, we administered a
                 CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (WIN). We predicted that if
                 CB1 activation is involved in the regulation of voluntary
                 wheel running, then HR mice would show a greater response to
                 CB1 agonism. Following our previous protocols, mice from
                 generation 53 were acclimated to running wheels for 24 days,
                 then received, in random order, either an intra-peritoneal
                 injection of vehicle or a low (0.5 mg/kg), medium (1 mg/kg) or
                 high dosage (3 mg/kg) of WIN. Each mouse received an injection
                 and then experienced two nights without injections, for a
                 total period of 12 days. Response to WIN was quantified as
                 wheel revolutions, time spent running, and average running
                 speed in the 10-120 min immediately following injection.
                 Injection decreased wheel revolutions in all mice, but male HR
                 mice decreased their running to a greater degree relative to
                 Controls in response to the high dose of WIN over the entire
                 period analyzed, whereas HR females showed a differential
                 response relative to Controls only in the latter 70-120 min
                 post-injection. These results, in conjunction with our
                 previous study, show that (a) aspects of endocannabinoid
                 signaling have diverged in four lines of mice bred for high
                 levels of voluntary exercise and (b) male and female HR mice
                 differ from one another in CB1 signaling as it relates to
                 wheel running.",
