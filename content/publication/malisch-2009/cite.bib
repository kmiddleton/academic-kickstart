                 resulting in elevated baseline glucocorticoid concentrations
                 is a hallmark of stress-related human anxiety and affective
                 disorders, including depression. Mice from four replicate
                 lines bred for high voluntary wheel running (HR lines) run
                 almost three times as much as four non-selected control (C)
                 lines, and exhibit two fold elevated baseline circulating
                 corticosterone levels throughout the 24 h cycle. Although
                 elevated baseline CORT may be beneficial for high locomotor
                 activity, chronic elevations can have deleterious effects on
                 multiple systems, and may predispose for affective disorders.
                 Because stressful events often precede a depressive bout, we
                 quantified depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim (FST;
                 generation 41) and tail-suspension tests (TST; generation 47)
                 in HR and C mice that had wheel access for 6 days and then
                 were deprived of wheels on day seven prior to the FST or TST.
                 Male HR spent significantly more time immobile in the FST than
                 C, suggesting that HR males have a predisposition for
                 depression-like behavior. Both male and female HR (generation
                 43) were more active than same-sex controls in both wheel
                 running and home-cage activity across 22 h (pooling the sexes,
                 HR/C = 2.28 and 2.66, respectively).",
